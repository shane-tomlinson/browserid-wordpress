== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find out more about Persona? =
https://login.persona.org/about

Try putting the following into this option:

`<img src="https://login.persona.org/i/persona_sign_in_red.png" />`

Now you will see a red 'Sign in with Persona' button instead of the traditional CSS button.

The assertion is verified by the server at https://verifier.login.persona.org/verify.
